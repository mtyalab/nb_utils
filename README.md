## Credits

This project is a fork of the excellent [`nb_utils`](https://github.com/icemanbsi/nb_utils) Flutter utility library developed and maintained by [@icemanbsi](https://github.com/icemanbsi).

All credit for the original work goes to the author.  
This fork was created to apply minor compatibility adjustments with Flutter SDK `3.29.x`, specifically removing the deprecated `useSystemColors` parameter from `ThemeData`.

If you're looking for the stable and up-to-date version of the package, please visit the official repository on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/nb_utils).
