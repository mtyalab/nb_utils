## Credits

This project is a fork of the well-maintained [`nb_utils`](https://github.com/bhoominn/nb_utils) Flutter utility library developed by [@bhoominn](https://github.com/bhoominn).

All credit for the original functionality and design goes to the author.

This fork was made to apply compatibility adjustments for Flutter SDK `3.29.x`, particularly by removing the deprecated `useSystemColors` parameter from `ThemeData`.

For stable versions and updates, please refer to the [original package on pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/nb_utils).
